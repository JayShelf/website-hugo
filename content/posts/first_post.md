dozen detectives from the California Highway Patrol gathered in a Los Angeles-area parking lot the other morning for an operational briefing. In about twenty minutes, they would drive to a nearby Home Depot, where customers were known to regularly wheel carts of merchandise out the door without paying, and to stick power tools down their pants. The investigators had planned a nightlong “blitz”—surveillance, arrest, repeat. Anyone caught stealing would be handcuffed, led to a back room, and questioned: What did you plan to do with these items? Did you take them on behalf of someone else? The goal was not to micro-police shoplifting but to discover and disrupt networks engaged in organized retail crime, a burgeoning area of criminal investigation.

A booster is a professional thief who typically sells to a fence—someone who resells stolen materials. A fence may buy a hundred-dollar drill from a booster for thirty bucks, to resell it for sixty. Or he may pay in drugs. In sworn testimony before a House committee on homeland security, Scott Glenn, Home Depot’s vice-president of asset protection, recently accused criminal organizations of recruiting vulnerable people into retail-theft schemes by preying on their need for “fast cash” or fentanyl. A fence may unload boosted goods at a swap meet, or at a store where illicit items are “washed” by commingling them with legitimate ones. Pilfered commodities often wind up online. Early in the pandemic, the pivot to e-commerce yielded new players eager to exploit the rogue freedoms of under-regulated commercial spaces. Amazon, eBay, OfferUp, Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace—bazaarland. The detectives in the parking lot, who were detailed to, or working with, the highway patrol’s Organized Retail Crime Task Force, had been trying to keep up. “If we could just get back to the days when we were dealing with the career criminals, it would be more manageable,” Captain Jeff Loftin, who heads a group of investigative units in the C.H.P.’s Southern Division, told me. “Now we’re having to deal with everybody and their brother, and trying to find out who they are.”

In the parking lot, Tom Probart, a bushily mustachioed detective in his thirties, distributed maps of the Home Depot’s layout and exits. Suspects rarely flee through Gardening, he told the other officers. The store’s back door opened onto a high wall, leaving the main entrance and Lumber as thieves’ likelier choices of egress. Probart pronounced “lumber” as “lumbar,” and his colleagues immediately gave him the appropriate amount of shit.

A two-officer “takedown” team would make arrests the moment a suspect left the store. “Let’s get them right away,” the task force’s supervisor, Sergeant Jimmy Eberhart, a soft-spoken perfectionist with a goatee and tattoo sleeves, told the officers. Foot pursuits and physical harm could be prevented with “the element of surprise—being on top of these guys before they even know we’re there.”

On the edge of the briefing circle stood half a dozen young men; one was wearing a sports jersey, another a Mickey Mouse sweatshirt. Don’t mistake them for suspects, Probart cautioned the C.H.P. detectives. The men were Home Depot loss-prevention employees—L.P.s—whose job is to prevent and investigate theft. L.P.s are not law-enforcement officers, though some used to be, and they have no arrest powers. In fact, a Home Depot employee can be fired for intervening in a theft. (A company spokesman has said, “No merchandise or other asset is worth risking the life of our associates or customers, which is why we have a strict policy against pursuing a shoplifter in a manner that creates a safety risk for anyone.”) Yet many organized-retail-crime investigations start with an L.P., who, like a private eye, may build a case by logging thefts, compiling names, taking photographs, and covertly following suspects around town. An energetic young L.P. shared with the task-force members a snapshot of a known booster who favored plumbing supplies, and said, “He really likes this store.”

At the Home Depot, some of the undercover officers waited behind the tinted windows of their unmarked Nissans and Jeeps; others went inside. Detective Amy Rodriguez, wearing skinny jeans and her hair in a sleek ponytail, strolled through the front door like a bored teen-ager, sipping from an In-N-Out Burger cup. A stubbled career detective called Cap, who was known for edging daringly close to surveilled subjects, wore a plaid flannel over a faded T-shirt. “If we were going to Beverly Hills or Macy’s, I’d probably dress a little differently,” he told me. (Yeah, no, Eberhart said later—Cap always dresses like that.) To the average person, the investigators would appear to be everyday shoppers, pondering paint chips or toilets.
